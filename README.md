Ludum Dare 37
--
This project was built on top of a home-grown [game jam boilerplate](https://github.com/ninjascribble/game-jam-boilerplate/releases/tag/1.0.0) project, which acts as a jumping-off point for building browser-based games with the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) JavaScript framework.

### Getting Started
Install all dependencies and run the dev server:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
When it completes your server should be available at http://localhost:8080
